**decision tree**
A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks.

**Random Forest**
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees.

**Multilayer Perceptron**
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that generates a set of outputs from a set of inputs. An MLP is characterized by several layers of input nodes connected as a directed graph between the input and output layers. MLP uses backpropogation for training the network.
